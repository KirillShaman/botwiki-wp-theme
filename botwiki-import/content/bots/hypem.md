**hypem** is a Snapchat video bot that publishes popular tracks from [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/) ([@hypem](https://twitter.com/hypem)), mixed with randomized nature footage. The bot is currently not interactive and posts the videos as Snapchat Stories.

It was created by [Anthony Volodkin](https://twitter.com/fascinated) (the founder of [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/)), and the Hype Machine team. You can read the announcement on [their blog](http://blog.hypem.com/2015/05/hype-machine-on-snapchat/).
